# Ingress Tools PWA

Ingress Tools implemented with PWA (Progress Web Apps), which has the ability to run completely offline.

So far, there is only a portal range calculator for planning long distance links.

Other features might be added later, or maybe not, it depends if I lost my interest. But you can definitely contribute to this project, and I'll view all pull requests.
